## Data Format

Each YAML file contains rules organized by section, with every rule carrying:

```yaml
- id: "NBCP-VIII-S001"          # Unique rule identifier
  section: "Rule VIII, Sec. 5"   # Official section reference
  description: "Minimum court width for 1-2 storey buildings"
  value: 2.0
  unit: "m"
  applies_to: ["R-1", "R-2", "R-3"]
  conditions:
    storeys_max: 2
  source: "2004 Revised IRR of PD 1096"
```

## Usage

### Python
```python
import yaml

with open("nbcp/setbacks.yaml") as f:
    rules = yaml.safe_load(f)

# Find R-1 front setback
for rule in rules["rules"]:
    if "R-1" in rule.get("applies_to", []) and "front" in rule.get("description", "").lower():
        print(f"{rule['description']}: {rule['value']}{rule['unit']}")
```

### Build JSON
```bash
python scripts/build_json.py          # Generates dist/*.json
python scripts/build_json.py --validate  # Validate against schema
```

## Contributing

This is a community effort to digitize Philippine building codes. Contributions welcome:

1. **Verify existing rules** — Cross-check values against official IRR documents
2. **Add missing provisions** — Many sections are not yet encoded
3. **Add LGU-specific overrides** — Local zoning ordinances may differ
4. **Improve metadata** — Add cross-references, exceptions, notes

### Rule ID Convention

Format: `{CODE}-{RULE}-{TYPE}{NUMBER}`

- Code: `NBCP`, `BP344`, `FC` (Fire Code), `FS` (Feng Shui), `TA` (Tropical Architecture), `GBC` (Green Building Code), `TR` (Design Trends)
- Rule: Roman numeral or section (e.g., `VIII`, `IRR`, `SITE`, `DOOR`, `ROOM`, `ELEM`, `WATER`, `STAIR`, `SHAPE`, `COMM`, `LAND`, `COOL`, `MAT`, `RAIN`, `ELEV`, `NRG`, `H2O`, `IEQ`, `TMOD`, `RESIL`, `SMART`, `LIFE`)
- Type: `S` (setback/siting), `H` (height/harvesting), `A` (area), `R` (ratio/room), `D` (dimension/door), `L` (load/landscape), `T` (time/distance/trend), `W` (water), `E` (element/elevated/energy), `C` (circulation), `F` (form), `B` (business), `V` (ventilation), `M` (material), `Q` (quality), `X` (ecology/site)
- Number: Sequential 3-digit (e.g., `001`)

### Feng Shui as Architectural Data

The Feng Shui rules are encoded using the same schema as legal building codes, making them queryable alongside compliance data. They are clearly marked as traditional design philosophy — not legal requirements. This allows architects and AI tools to run a single query that returns both code compliance results and Feng Shui design recommendations.

**Example:** "Is my south-facing door compliant?" returns:
- `NBCP-VIII-S001`: Front setback 4.5m — PASS (legal)
- `FS-SITE-S010`: South facing preferred for prosperity — PASS (Feng Shui)
- `FS-DOOR-D010`: Check front-to-back door alignment — CHECK (Feng Shui)
